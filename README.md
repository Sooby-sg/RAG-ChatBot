# RAG-ChatBot

## Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a system that uses AI models to answer
fashion-related questions with comprehensive and accessible responses. By offering
insightful and contextually relevant information, the system aims to enhance user
experience by assisting users in finding fashion products that match their interests.
## Design:
This project consists of two main layers: the search layer and the generation layer. The
search layer identifies relevant fashion items in the dataset through keyword matching or
specified criteria. The generation layer synthesizes this information to create detailed
answers to user queries, utilizing advanced AI models like GPT-3.5 to produce natural
language responses.
## Implementation:
The implementation involved several steps, including data preprocessing, model
integration and query response generation.
## Data Processing:
The format of the CSV dataset was designed to enhance readability and data quality.
Decimal points were standardized, blank entries were updated, and redundant columns
were removed. Additionally, text columns were cleaned to remove HTML tags and
unnecessary characters.
